  <h1>JS & jQuery Flashcards</h1>
  <button class="btn btn-warning" id="js">JavaScript(JS)</button>
    <p id="p-js"> An object-oriented computer programming language commonly used to create interactive effects within web browsers.</p>
  <button class="btn btn-warning" id="operators">Operators</button>
    <p>Operator is a symbol that is used to perform an operation. Most often these operations are arithmetic (addition, subtraction, etc), but not always.</p>
  <button class="btn btn-warning" id="variables">Variables</button>
    <p>Variable means anything that can vary. JavaScript includes variables which hold the data value and it can be changed anytime.</p>
  <button class="btn btn-warning" id="conventions">Variable naming conventions</button>
    <p>They must begin with a letter or an underscore character. For example, 123test is an invalid variable name but _123test is a valid one. JavaScript variable names are case-sensitive. For example, Name and name are two different variables.</p>
  <button class="btn btn-warning" id="functions">Functions</button>
    <p>A function is a JavaScript procedure—a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value. To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it. </p>
  <button class="btn btn-warning" id="methods">Methods</button>
    <p>JavaScript methods are actions that can be performed on objects. A JavaScript method is a property containing a function definition. Methods are functions stored as object properties.</p>
  <button class="btn btn-warning" id="arguments">Arguments</button>
    <p>arguments is an Array -like object accessible inside functions that contains the values of the arguments passed to that function. ... Note: “Array-like” means that arguments has a length property and properties indexed from zero, but it doesn't have Array 's built-in methods like forEach() and map() </p>
  <button class="btn btn-warning" id="parameters">Parameters</button>
    <p>Parameters are variables listed as a part of the function definition. </p>
  <button class="btn btn-warning" id="return">Return</button>
    <p>When a return statement is used in a function body, the execution of the function is stopped. If specified, a given value is returned to the function caller. For example, the following function returns the square of its argument, x , where x is a number. If the value is omitted, undefined is returned instead</p>
  <button class="btn btn-warning" id="chaining">Chaining methods</button>
    <p>Chaining Methods, also known as Cascading, refers to repeatedly calling one method after another on an object, in one continuous line of code. This technique abounds in jQuery and other JavaScript libraries and it is even common in some JavaScript native methods.</p>
  <button class="btn btn-warning" id="strings">Strings</button>
    <p>A string is a sequence of one or more characters that may consist of letters, numbers, or symbols. Strings in JavaScript are primitive data types and immutable, which means they are unchanging.</p>
  <button class="btn btn-warning" id="booleans">Booleans</button>
    <p>Boolean is a datatype that returns either of two values i.e. true or false. In JavaScript, boolean is used as a function to get the value of a variable, object, conditions, expressions etc. in terms of true or false. Example of boolean values: Here a1 and a2 stores the boolean value i.e. true and false respectively</p>
  <button class="btn btn-warning" id="undefined">Undefined</button>
    <p>JavaScript assigns 'undefined' to any object that has been declared but not initialized or defined.</p>
  <button class="btn btn-warning" id="nan">NaN</button>
    <p>he NaN property represents "Not-a-Number" value. This property indicates that a value is not a legal number. The NaN property is the same as the Number. </p>
  <button class="btn btn-warning" id="escape">Escape</button>
    <p>The escape() function encodes a string. This function makes a string portable, so it can be transmitted across any network to any computer that supports ASCII characters.</p>
  <button class="btn btn-warning" id="alert">Alert</button>
    <p>The alert JavaScript function is a beginner-friendly method of displaying a modal window in pages. Note: modal windows stop the code execution until users interact with the displayed message (click OK). In our example of alert in JavaScript, we use a playful message in the dialog box.</p>
  <button class="btn btn-warning" id="comments">Comments</button>
    <p>Comments in JavaScript are used to explain the code and make the program more readable for developers. ... There are single-line comments (which comment out one line or a part of one line) and multi-line comments (which comment out a block of code). Multi-line comments are more often used for formal documentations.</p>
  <button class="btn btn-warning" id="jquery">jQuery</button>
    <p>jQuery is an open-sourced JavaScript library that simplifies creation and navigation of web applications. Specifically, jQuery simplifies HTML Document Object Model (DOM) manipulation, Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (Ajax) and event handling.</p>
  <button class="btn btn-warning" name="attributes">Attributes</button>
    <p class='attributes'>attributes define how the property can be accessed (is it readable?, is it writable?) In JavaScript, all attributes can be read, but only the value attribute can be changed (and only if the property is writable).</p>
